The 'anniversaries' component is a Home Assistant custom sensor which counts down to a recurring date such as birthdays, but can be used for any anniversary which occurs annually on the same date.

State Returned:

* The number of days remaining to the next occurance.

Attributes:

* years at next anniversary: number of years that will have passed at the next occurrence  _(NOT displayed if year is unknown)_
* current years: number of years have passed since the first occurance (ie, current age)  _(NOT displayed if year is unknown)_
* date:  The date of the first occurence _(or the date of the next occurence if year is unknown)_ (formatted by the date_format attribute if set)
* weeks_remaining: The number of weeks until the anniversary
* unit_of_measurement: 'Days' By default, this is displayed after the state. _this is NOT translate-able.  See below for work-around_
* half_anniversary_date: The date of the next half anniversary (if enabled by `show_half_anniversary`)
* days_until_half_anniversary: The number of days until the next half anniversary

## Notes about unit of measurement

Unit_of_measurement is *not* translate-able.
You can, however, change the text for unit of measurement in the configuration.  NB the sensor will always report in days, this just allows you to represent this in your own language.

## Configuration

Anniversaries can be configured on the integrations menu or in configuration.yaml

### Config Flow

In Configuration/Integrations click on the + button, select Anniversaries and configure the options on the form.

### configuration.yaml

Add `anniversaries` sensor in your `configuration.yaml`. The following example adds two sensors - Shakespeare's birthday and wedding anniversary!

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

anniversaries:
  sensors:
  - name: Shakespeare's Birthday
    date: '1564-04-23'
  - name: Shakespeare's Wedding Anniversary
    date: '1582-11-27'
```
